## Feedback

This exercise was so exciting to do cause it's my first exercise in React with Typescript. It was difficult at the start but as I went along, I felt more and more comfortable. Also it's the first time I used github's API, I think that it's an easy API to try, even when I had some problems because due to an error I made too many requests and was denied access while I was still doing the development. I learned a lot about Typescript and React and I'm sure that in my next projects will be in Typescript!
